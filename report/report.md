# CS 415 MP2 Report | Shengjie Ma

### Level Overview

The theme of this game level is "climbing the hill," where the objective is to reach a giant coin located at the top. 
The level is divided into two distinct layers of different elevations. The player begins on the lower layer, while the destination is situated on the higher layer.

#### Part 1: The Start

The starting area is a flat terrain where the player encounters a Pursuer. This enemy chases the player, but its speed is slower, making this an easy encounter. The purpose of this section is to familiarize the player with basic character controls.

#### Part 2: Threat from Above

After traversing a mountain path, the player reaches Part 2. Here, a Mortar located on the higher layer rains down bombs, which the player must dodge while battling another Pursuer on the lower layer. At this stage, the player cannot reach the Mortar, adding an element of danger to the fight.

#### Part 3: Jumping Challenge

In this section, the player must navigate a series of floating islands to ascend to the higher layer. The jumps are challenging, and falling off results in instant death. If the player successfully reaches the top, they will finally have the opportunity to take down the Mortar.

#### Part 4: Boss Fight

The final section features a boss battle in an arena. The boss, known as the Charger, attacks by charging at high speed but cannot change direction once it begins. If the Charger collides with a wall, it becomes momentarily stunned, giving the player a window to strike.

### Player Guidance

Three types of hints are used to guide the player toward the final destination:

- **Final Destination Visibility**  
  The ultimate goal, the giant coin, is visible from the very start of the game, providing a clear visual cue.
  
- **Enemy Placement**  
  The Mortar, positioned on the higher layer, throws bombs down toward the player, encouraging them to find a way to reach the upper level.

- **Collectibles**  
  There are two types of collectibles. **"Easy" collectibles** are placed at the entrance to the next section, helping to guide the player forward. **"Hard" collectibles** are hidden in less obvious locations, rewarding players who explore the map more thoroughly.
